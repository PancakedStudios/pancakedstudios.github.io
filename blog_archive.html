        Do you want to see old Pancaked Studios blogposts? </br>
        </br>
        Here you go! What is this exactly? Well. </br>
        </br>
        It's the old Pancaked Studios website from early 2022 to mid 2022. </br>
        It was made with Wordpress, a system for hosting both a website and a blog on the same site. </br>
        This was made right back when Chao Adventure was being made with </br>
        Microsoft's XNA Framework instead of GameMaker, </br>
        and was also before SAGE 2022 was even announced. </br>
        We were trying to make a demo before it was announced. </br>
        </br>
        When you visit this site, please note that it's very outdated. Not in design, </br>
        (this site looks more outdated then our old one) </br>
        but in information. There is only 1 post from this that was from when the game was </br>
        being made with GameMaker. </br>
        </br>
        Alright, enough talk, you probably just want to go to the site. </br>
        And, here it is! </br>
        </br>
        I heavily suggest you to go back to the startpage once you're done. </br>
